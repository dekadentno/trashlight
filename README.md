# trashlight

Set up your [Yeelight color LED Bulb](https://www.yeelight.com/en_US/product/lemon2-color) to notify you with flashing with the color of the trash can that you have to bring out for pickup.

In my place, for recycling purposes, we have 3 trash/waste bins: blue for paper, yellow for plastic and green for mixed house trash. My feverish and lazy ass wanted a way to inform me when to bring the trash cans out, so I came up with this solution.
